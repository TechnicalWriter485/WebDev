  <h2>Low and Slow</h2>
  <p>This week I am extremely excited about a new
    cooking technique called <em><b>sous vide</b></em>. In sous vide
    cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed
    in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely
    set to the target temperature you want the food
    to be cooked to. In his book, Cooking for Geeks,
    Jeff Potter describes it as ultra-low-temperature
    poaching.</p>
  <p>Next month, we will be serving Sous Vide Salmon
    with Dill Hollandaise. <br>To reserve a seat at the chef
    table, contact us before <time>November 30</time>.</p>

  <p>Warning: Sous vide cooked salmon is not
    pasteurized. Avoid it if you are pregnant or have
    immunity issues.</p>
